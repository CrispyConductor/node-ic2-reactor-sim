Module to do automatic simulations of Minecraft Industrial Craft 2 nuclear reactors.  The mechanics simulated are based on the decompiled code of IC2 2_2.0.397-EXPERIMENTAL .  Many of the simulations performed by this simulator are more accurate than existing simulators, due to this being based on the decompiled code itself (albeit optimized).
